<h1>The Senior's Guide to Web Mining: Supporting Content Without Getting Scammed</h1>

<blockquote><em>"You know what's frustrating? Spending decades mastering technology only to have the internet turn into a minefield of subscriptions, tracking, and schemes designed to confuse. Web mining might be the most straightforward option left."</em></blockquote>

<hr>

You know that feeling when you're trying to read a recipe online, and before you can get to the actual ingredients, you've been hit with three video ads, two pop-ups asking for your email address, a notification request, and a plea to subscribe for $4.99 a month? And you're thinking, <em>"I just want to know how long to bake the casserole. When did everything get so complicated?"</em>

If you're over 60 and feeling exhausted by the internet's constant demands for money, attention, or personal information, you're not imagining things. The web really has gotten more predatory, more confusing, and more expensive. And it's not because you "don't understand technology"‚Äîit's because the business model of the internet changed, and that new model depends on making things deliberately complicated.

But here's something you might not have heard about yet: there's a straightforward alternative called web mining that lets you support websites you like without subscriptions, without ads tracking you, and without handing over credit card numbers to a dozen different companies. And contrary to what you might have heard about "cryptocurrency" (which does sound intimidating), this particular approach is actually simpler and more transparent than what we're dealing with now.

Let me explain how it works, why it's different from scams, and whether it makes sense for you.

<hr>

<h2>ü§î What Is Web Mining, Actually?</h2>

<strong>Here's the simplest explanation:</strong>

When you visit a website that uses ethical web mining, it asks for your permission to use a small amount of your computer's processing power (like 10-25%) to do mathematical calculations. Those calculations help secure a privacy-focused cryptocurrency called Monero, and the website earns a few cents from that work.

<h3><strong>Think of It Like This</strong></h3>

<strong>Similar to things you already understand:</strong>

| <strong>It's Like...</strong> | <strong>How Web Mining Works</strong> |
|---|---|
| <strong>Leaving a tip jar on the counter</strong> | Website says "if you want to support us, leave your browser open and we'll earn from your computer's spare capacity" |
| <strong>Community radio pledge drives</strong> | "If everyone contributes a little, we can keep the station running without corporate sponsors" |
| <strong>Donating blood</strong> | You give something you're not using (spare computational power), it helps others, you can stop anytime |
| <strong>A library card</strong> | Free access to resources, funded by everyone in the community contributing what they can |

<strong>NOT like:</strong>
<ul><li>‚ùå Those emails claiming you've won money (web mining asks permission first and tells you exactly what happens)</li>
<li>‚ùå Viruses or malware (ethical mining requires your explicit "yes" and runs in your browser where you can see it)</li>
<li>‚ùå Credit card fraud (no payment information needed at all)</li>
<li>‚ùå Investment schemes (nobody promises you'll make money‚Äîthis is about supporting websites)</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>‚úÖ How to Tell Real Web Mining From Scams</h2>

You've lived through enough schemes to have good instincts. Here's how to apply them to web mining:

<h3><strong>Red Flags That Mean "Stay Away"</strong></h3>

<strong>If someone's talking about web mining and they say any of this, walk away:</strong>

üö© <strong>"You can get rich quick!"</strong>
<ul><li>Real mining makes pennies, not dollars</li>
<li>Anyone promising big returns is lying</li>
<li>Supporting websites, not getting rich, is the actual goal</li>
</ul>
<p>üö© <strong>"You have to buy something first"</strong></p>
<ul><li>Legitimate mining is free to participate in</li>
<li>No "starter packs" or "premium memberships" needed</li>
<li>If they want your credit card, it's not real web mining</li>
</ul>
<p>üö© <strong>"Download this program to your computer"</strong></p>
<ul><li>Real web mining happens IN your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)</li>
<li>Legitimate mining never requires installing software</li>
<li>Downloaded programs could be viruses</li>
</ul>
<p>üö© <strong>"You need to invest cryptocurrency to start"</strong></p>
<ul><li>Real mining just uses your browser's spare capacity</li>
<li>No buying crypto, no sending crypto, no "staking"</li>
<li>If they mention Bitcoin or investments, it's probably a scam</li>
</ul>
<p>üö© <strong>"Act now before the opportunity closes!"</strong></p>
<ul><li>Pressure tactics are always a bad sign</li>
<li>Legitimate technology doesn't have limited time offers</li>
<li>If they rush you, they're trying to prevent you from thinking clearly</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Green Flags That Mean "This Might Be Legitimate"</strong></h3>

<strong>If you see these things, it's more likely to be real:</strong>

‚úÖ <strong>Clear "yes" or "no" choice</strong>
<ul><li>Dialog box asks: "Support this site with mining? Yes/No"</li>
<li>Explaining what will happen and what it costs (electricity)</li>
<li>Easy to decline, easy to stop later</li>
</ul>
<p>‚úÖ <strong>No payment information requested</strong></p>
<ul><li>No credit cards, no bank accounts, no PayPal</li>
<li>No personal information beyond maybe an email address</li>
<li>You're giving computer time, not money</li>
</ul>
<p>‚úÖ <strong>You can see it running</strong></p>
<ul><li>Shows how much CPU it's using (like "25% of one processor")</li>
<li>Displays an indicator that mining is active</li>
<li>Has a visible "STOP" button you can click anytime</li>
</ul>
<p>‚úÖ <strong>Open source code</strong></p>
<ul><li>The program is public and can be inspected by experts</li>
<li>Uses established cryptocurrency (Monero) not some made-up coin</li>
<li>Technical people can verify it's doing what it claims</li>
</ul>
<p>‚úÖ <strong>Reasonable about earnings</strong></p>
<ul><li>Says things like "This helps us keep the lights on"</li>
<li>NOT "You'll earn $500 a month!"</li>
<li>Honest that income is small and goes to the website</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>üìä The Real Numbers: What Does This Actually Cost You?</h2>

Let's talk practically about what web mining means for your computer and electricity bill.

<h3><strong>Electricity Cost Reality Check</strong></h3>

<strong>What mining at 25% capacity actually costs:</strong>

| <strong>Your Situation</strong> | <strong>Approximate Monthly Cost</strong> | <strong>Comparison</strong> |
|---|---|---|
| <strong>Laptop (newer, efficient)</strong> | $0.50 - $1.50/month | Less than one coffee |
| <strong>Desktop computer</strong> | $1.00 - $3.00/month | About the same as leaving a light bulb on |
| <strong>Gaming computer</strong> | $2.00 - $5.00/month | Still cheaper than one streaming service |
| <strong>Old computer (pre-2015)</strong> | $3.00 - $8.00/month | Probably not worth it |

<strong>Important context:</strong>
<ul><li>These costs assume mining 24/7 at 25% capacity</li>
<li>Most people only mine while actively reading/browsing (much less)</li>
<li>Compare to Netflix ($15.49), NYT digital ($17), or any other subscription</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What Actually Happens to Your Computer</strong></h3>

<strong>At 25% throttle (the common setting):</strong>

‚úÖ <strong>What you'll notice:</strong>
<ul><li>Maybe your fan runs a bit more (same as watching YouTube)</li>
<li>Computer might feel slightly warmer (normal and safe)</li>
<li>Battery drains faster on laptop (about 20% faster, which is noticeable)</li>
</ul>
<p>‚úÖ <strong>What you WON'T notice:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Your browsing won't slow down</li>
<li>Videos will still play fine</li>
<li>Email, writing, reading work normally</li>
<li>Modern computers (2015+) handle this easily</li>
</ul>
<p>‚ùå <strong>When NOT to mine:</strong></p>
<ul><li>On very old computers (pre-2010)</li>
<li>On smartphones (unless plugged in)</li>
<li>When on battery power and need it to last</li>
<li>If your computer is already struggling</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>üõ°Ô∏è Protecting Yourself: Practical Safety Guidelines</h2>

You didn't make it this far in life by being careless. Here's how to apply that wisdom to web mining:

<h3><strong>Safe Exploration Approach</strong></h3>

<strong>Step 1: Learn first, try later</strong>
<ul><li>Read about it, don't rush into anything</li>
<li>Talk to family members who understand tech</li>
<li>Check with your local library or senior center tech helpers</li>
<li>This essay is a good start; share it with someone who can discuss</li>
</ul>
<strong>Step 2: Start with trusted sites only</strong>
<ul><li>If your local news site or favorite blog offers mining, that's safer</li>
<li>Avoid sites you've never heard of</li>
<li>Stick with content creators you already trust</li>
<li>If something feels off, trust that feeling</li>
</ul>
<strong>Step 3: Try it on one site first</strong>
<ul><li>Don't enable mining on a dozen sites at once</li>
<li>Pick one website you visit regularly and trust</li>
<li>See how it works for a few days</li>
<li>Monitor your computer's behavior</li>
</ul>
<strong>Step 4: Check your electric bill</strong>
<ul><li>Before you start, note your current monthly usage</li>
<li>After a month of mining, compare</li>
<li>If the cost increase bothers you, stop</li>
<li>Nobody should guilt you into continuing</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Questions to Ask Before Saying Yes</strong></h3>

<strong>When a website asks to mine:</strong>

<li><strong>Do I trust this website already?</strong></li>
   - Have I been visiting for years?
   - Do I know who runs it?
   - Have they been honest with me before?

<li><strong>Is the request clear and respectful?</strong></li>
   - Do they explain what mining means?
   - Can I easily say no?
   - Is there a visible stop button?

<li><strong>Are they being honest about the trade-off?</strong></li>
   - Do they mention it uses electricity?
   - Do they acknowledge it's a small amount?
   - Are they realistic (not promising you'll make money)?

<li><strong>Can I verify it's working as promised?</strong></li>
   - Can I see how much CPU it's using?
   - Does Task Manager show reasonable usage?
   - Can someone tech-savvy check for me?

<strong>If the answer to any of these is "no" or "I'm not sure," don't enable mining.</strong>

<hr>

<h2>ü§ù Why This Might Actually Be Better Than Alternatives</h2>

Here's why some people your age are choosing web mining over the other options:

<h3><strong>Comparing Your Choices for Supporting Content</strong></h3>

<strong>Option 1: Advertising (the current default)</strong>
<ul><li>‚úÖ Free to you (no direct cost)</li>
<li>‚ùå Tracks everything you do online</li>
<li>‚ùå Sells your data to unknown companies  </li>
<li>‚ùå Clutters pages with distracting content</li>
<li>‚ùå Often malicious (malware in ads is real)</li>
<li>‚ùå Slower page loading</li>
<li>‚ùå Privacy invasion you can't see or control</li>
</ul>
<strong>Option 2: Subscriptions (the paywall approach)</strong>
<ul><li>‚úÖ No ads, cleaner experience</li>
<li>‚úÖ Better privacy usually</li>
<li>‚ùå Expensive ($5-$20 per site per month)</li>
<li>‚ùå Requires credit card for each site</li>
<li>‚ùå Hard to manage (which ones are you paying for?)</li>
<li>‚ùå Excludes people on fixed incomes</li>
<li>‚ùå Need to remember to cancel if you stop using</li>
</ul>
<strong>Option 3: Web Mining (the new option)</strong>
<ul><li>‚úÖ Free to try, stop anytime</li>
<li>‚úÖ No credit card or personal info needed</li>
<li>‚úÖ No tracking or data collection</li>
<li>‚úÖ Support multiple sites with one decision</li>
<li>‚úÖ Transparent about what's happening</li>
<li>‚úÖ Uses something you already have (computer power)</li>
<li>‚ùå Small electricity cost ($1-3/month typically)</li>
<li>‚ùå Not ideal for very old computers</li>
<li>‚ùå Requires learning something new</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Why Simplicity Matters for Seniors</strong></h3>

<strong>Let's be honest about what matters at our stage of life:</strong>

You probably don't want to:
<ul><li>Manage 15 different subscription passwords</li>
<li>Hand out your credit card to every website</li>
<li>Deal with "free trials" that auto-renew</li>
<li>Navigate complicated privacy settings</li>
<li>Worry about whether your data is being sold</li>
</ul>
<strong>Web mining avoids ALL of those problems</strong> because:
<ul><li>No passwords or accounts needed</li>
<li>No payment information stored anywhere</li>
<li>One decision ("yes, mine" or "no, don't mine")</li>
<li>Completely transparent operation</li>
<li>Privacy-respecting by design (Monero is anonymous)</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>üí≠ Common Concerns Seniors Have (Answered Honestly)</h2>

<strong>Concern: "I'm not good with technology. This seems complicated."</strong>

<em>Reality:</em> If you can use a web browser, you can use web mining. When a site asks permission, you click "Yes" or "No"‚Äîthat's it. Literally two buttons. You've handled more complicated remote controls.

The cryptocurrency part happens automatically in the background. You never see it, touch it, or think about it. It's like how you don't need to understand HTTP protocols to visit websites.

<strong>Concern: "What if I forget to turn it off and waste electricity?"</strong>

<em>Reality:</em> Most implementations automatically stop when you close the browser or navigate away from the site. Even if it ran 24/7, we're talking about the cost of leaving a nightlight on‚Äînot leaving your oven on all day.

Set a calendar reminder to check it once a month if you're worried. Or ask a family member to help you check your Task Manager occasionally.

<strong>Concern: "Is this some kind of pyramid scheme or MLM?"</strong>

<em>Reality:</em> No. Pyramid schemes require you to recruit other people. Web mining just uses your computer. You're not selling anything, recruiting anyone, or building a "downline." You're just letting a website you already visit use spare computer power.

If anyone tells you to "recruit others" or "build a team," that's NOT legitimate web mining‚Äîthat's a scam using mining as cover.

<strong>Concern: "Will this slow down my computer?"</strong>

<em>Reality:</em> At typical throttle levels (10-25%), no. Modern computers have multiple processors. Mining uses part of one processor, leaving the others free for what you're actually doing.

It's like how your car can run the air conditioning while driving‚Äîboth use the engine, but the engine is powerful enough to handle both. If you're on a very old computer, though, skip this.

<strong>Concern: "What happens if I click 'yes' by accident?"</strong>

<em>Reality:</em> Nothing permanent. You can click "stop" immediately. Or close your browser. Or restart your computer. Web mining doesn't install anything, doesn't modify system settings, doesn't persist after you leave.

It's not like downloading a program you then have to figure out how to uninstall. It only works while you're on that specific website with that specific tab open.

<strong>Concern: "Are there tax implications?"</strong>

<em>Reality:</em> For you personally? Almost certainly not. The website earns the cryptocurrency, not you. You're donating computational resources, like donating your time to volunteer work. You don't pay taxes on volunteering.

That said, tax rules vary by location and change. If you're earning cryptocurrency yourself (different from letting a website mine), consult a tax professional. But for typical "support this site by mining" scenarios, there's nothing for you to report.

<strong>Concern: "What if the website is lying and actually doing something malicious?"</strong>

<em>This is the most important question.</em> Here's how to protect yourself:

<ul><li>Only enable mining on websites you already trust deeply</li>
<li>Use sites that show their code publicly (open source)</li>
<li>Ask tech-savvy family to verify the site for you</li>
<li>Watch your Task Manager to see CPU usage matches what they claim</li>
<li>Use browser extensions that can monitor what sites are doing</li>
<li>If anything feels wrong, close the tab immediately</li>
</ul>
<p>Trust your instincts. If something feels shady, it probably is.</p>
<hr>

<h2>üéØ Should YOU Try Web Mining?</h2>

<strong>This might be a good fit if:</strong>

‚úÖ You visit 3-5 websites regularly that you trust and want to support  
‚úÖ You're tired of managing multiple subscriptions and passwords  
‚úÖ You're uncomfortable with how ads track you  
‚úÖ Your computer is from 2015 or newer  
‚úÖ You're comfortable with $1-3/month electricity cost  
‚úÖ You're willing to learn something new  
‚úÖ You have someone tech-savvy who can help you get started safely

<strong>This probably isn't for you if:</strong>

‚ùå Your computer is very old (pre-2010)  
‚ùå You're on an extremely tight fixed income where $2/month matters  
‚ùå You primarily use tablets or smartphones  
‚ùå You're not comfortable clicking "yes" to new technology  
‚ùå You don't have anyone to help troubleshoot if needed  
‚ùå You mostly use the library's computers (not your own)  
‚ùå You're happy with current subscription model or don't mind ads

<strong>There's no wrong answer here.</strong> Web mining is ONE option, not the ONLY option. Don't let anyone pressure you.

<hr>

<h2>üöÄ If You Decide to Try It: Getting Started Safely</h2>

<strong>A conservative, careful approach:</strong>

<h3><strong>Phase 1: Education (1-2 weeks)</strong></h3>

<li><strong>Learn more about Monero cryptocurrency</strong> (the privacy-focused one used for web mining)</li>
   - Read Wikipedia article on Monero
   - Understand it's legitimate, not a scam coin
   - Note that it's designed for privacy (transactions are anonymous)

<li><strong>Research specific implementations</strong></li>
   - WebMiner project (ethical, open source)
   - Read user experiences on sites you trust
   - Check technology reviews from reputable sources

<li><strong>Talk to family or friends</strong></li>
   - Especially if they work in tech
   - Ask them to explain it in person
   - Have them check specific sites you're considering

<h3><strong>Phase 2: Testing (1 month)</strong></h3>

<li><strong>Pick ONE website you've trusted for years</strong></li>
   - Your local newspaper's site
   - A blog you've read for a decade
   - A resource site you use weekly

<li><strong>Enable mining at the LOWEST setting</strong></li>
   - Ask for 10% throttle if you can choose
   - Only mine while actively reading, not 24/7
   - Set a timer to revisit in 30 minutes and see how it feels

<li><strong>Monitor your experience</strong></li>
   - Is your computer noticeably slower? (shouldn't be)
   - Is your fan very loud? (slight increase is normal, jet engine noise is not)
   - Are you uncomfortable? (if yes, stop immediately)

<li><strong>Check your electricity bill after one month</strong></li>
   - Compare to previous month
   - Account for seasonal differences (A/C, heating)
   - Decide if the cost is acceptable

<h3><strong>Phase 3: Decision (after testing)</strong></h3>

Based on your one-month test, you have three options:

<strong>Option A: Continue</strong>
<ul><li>Keep mining on that one site</li>
<li>Maybe add 1-2 more sites you trust</li>
<li>Monitor ongoing and adjust as needed</li>
</ul>
<strong>Option B: Modify</strong>
<ul><li>Reduce throttle percentage</li>
<li>Only mine when computer is plugged in</li>
<li>Set specific hours (like "only afternoon")</li>
</ul>
<strong>Option C: Stop</strong>
<ul><li>Disable mining completely</li>
<li>No judgment‚Äîit's not for everyone</li>
<li>You learned something new, that's valuable</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>ü§ù Having the Conversation with Family</h2>

Your kids or grandkids might worry when they hear you're considering "cryptocurrency mining." Here's how to have that conversation:

<h3><strong>What to Tell Concerned Family Members</strong></h3>

"I'm learning about a new way to support websites without subscriptions or ads. It's called web mining. Before you worry, here's what it actually is:

<ul><li>It's not investing money‚ÄîI'm not buying anything</li>
<li>It's not a get-rich-quick scheme‚ÄîI'm not trying to make money</li>
<li>It's using spare computer processing power to support sites I already visit</li>
<li>It's like a more tech-savvy version of leaving a tip jar</li>
<li>I'm being careful: only trying it on [specific trusted site]</li>
<li>I've read about how to spot scams and this isn't one</li>
<li>I'd like you to help me verify the site is legitimate</li>
<li>Can you help me monitor it for the first month?"</li>

<h3><strong>What to Ask Them for Help With</strong></h3>

"I want to be smart about this. Can you help me:

<li>Check if [website name] is using legitimate web mining or something sketchy</li>
<li>Show me how to use Task Manager to see what my CPU is doing</li>
<li>Help me understand if the electricity cost is reasonable</li>
<li>Make sure I can easily stop it if I need to</li>
<li>Set up a monthly reminder to review this decision"</li>

<strong>The goal:</strong> Show you're informed, careful, and open to guidance‚Äînot dismissive of their concerns or stubborn about trying something risky.

<h2>üìñ Real-World Example: What This Looks Like in Practice</h2>

<strong>Meet "Dorothy" (not her real name, but based on real experiences):</strong>

Dorothy is 68, lives on social security and a modest pension, and loves reading gardening blogs and historical society websites. She was frustrated because:

<ul><li>Three of her favorite sites went behind paywalls ($5, $7, and $4/month = $16/month)</li>
<li>She couldn't afford $16/month for hobby reading</li>
<li>The free sites had so many ads they were hard to read</li>
<li>She felt guilty using ad-blockers because she knew sites need revenue</li>
</ul>
<strong>What Dorothy tried:</strong>
<p>She asked her grandson (a programmer) to explain web mining. He verified that her favorite gardening blog used legitimate WebMiner software. Together they:</p>
<li>Tested it on her desktop computer (from 2018)</li>
<li>Set throttle to 20%</li>
<li>Only enabled it when she was reading the blog (not 24/7)</li>
<li>Checked her electricity bill after one month</li>
<strong>Results after three months:</strong>
<ul><li>Electricity cost: about $2.50/month (she checked three consecutive bills)</li>
<li>Computer performance: no noticeable slowdown</li>
<li>Site experience: clean pages, no ads, faster loading</li>
<li>Her feeling: "It's like putting a quarter in the donation box at the botanical garden"</li>
</ul>
<strong>Dorothy's conclusion:</strong> "For less than one coffee per month, I can read three blogs I love without ads or subscriptions. I wish I'd known about this years ago."
<strong>Your experience will vary,</strong> but Dorothy's story shows what responsible exploration looks like.

<h2>‚öñÔ∏è The Bigger Picture: Why This Matters for Everyone</h2>

You've seen the internet evolve from simple email to today's complex tracking ecosystem. You remember when:

<ul><li>Websites were just information, not data collection engines</li>
<li>"Free" actually meant free, not "free if you let us surveil you"</li>
<li>You could read an article without 12 interruptions</li>
<li>Privacy was assumed, not negotiated through incomprehensible legal documents</li>
</ul>
<strong>Web mining is trying to get back to something better:</strong>
<p>A web where:</p>
<ul><li>Creators can earn without selling your data</li>
<li>Readers can access content without subscriptions or tracking</li>
<li>The exchange is transparent and honest</li>
<li>Everyone understands the trade-offs</li>
<li>You have real control, not fake choice</li>
</ul>
<p>It won't fix everything. But it's a step toward an internet that respects your intelligence, your privacy, and your autonomy‚Äîwhich you absolutely deserve after dealing with the current mess for years.</p>

<h2>üéì Resources for Learning More</h2>

<strong>Trustworthy places to learn (not trying to sell you anything):</strong>

<li><strong>Wikipedia articles:</strong></li>
   - "Cryptocurrency" (general overview)
   - "Monero" (specific to what web mining uses)
   - "Proof of work" (how mining actually functions)

<li><strong>Senior-focused tech resources:</strong></li>
   - AARP's technology guides (they cover cryptocurrencies honestly)
   - Senior Planet (courses on understanding new tech)
   - Your local library's tech help desk

<li><strong>Technical documentation:</strong></li>
   - WebMiner GitHub repository (if you have tech-savvy help)
   - Monero project website (explains the privacy focus)

<li><strong>Consumer protection:</strong></li>
   - FTC guidelines on cryptocurrency scams
   - AARP Fraud Watch Network
   - Your state attorney general's consumer protection division

<strong>Ask your librarian</strong> to help you find these resources. That's what they're there for, and they're usually delighted when seniors want to learn new things.

<h2>üí° Final Thoughts: You're Smarter Than They Think</h2>

The internet assumes older adults are easy targets‚Äîtechnologically confused, financially desperate, socially isolated. Scammers design their schemes around those assumptions.

<strong>But you know better.</strong> You've:
<ul><li>Survived decades of "too good to be true" offers</li>
<li>Learned to spot manipulation from a mile away</li>
<li>Developed good instincts about when something feels wrong</li>
<li>Figured out plenty of technology already (email, smartphones, banking apps)</li>
</ul>
<p>Web mining isn't magic. It's not complicated. And it's not trying to trick you‚Äîat least, the legitimate version isn't. It's just a different way to fund websites, one that happens to be more honest and straightforward than what we're dealing with now.</p>
<strong>Whether you try it or not is completely up to you.</strong> But you deserve to understand it, evaluate it on its merits, and make an informed choice‚Äîwhich is exactly what this guide is for.
<p>The internet can be better than it is now. And people who remember what the internet used to be like‚Äîbefore everything became a scheme to monetize attention‚Äîare exactly the people who can help build something better.</p>
<em>You're not behind the times. You're just ahead of the current mess.</em>
