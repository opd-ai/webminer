# When NOT to Mine: A Resource Priority Guide

> *"Let's be clear: if you're rendering a video, compiling code, or in a boss fight, stop mining. Your work comes first."*

---

You know that moment when someone pitches you a "side hustle" and they somehow forget to mention all the situations where it's actually a terrible idea? Like those "work from home" schemes that don't tell you about the family members who'll interrupt you every five minutes, or the "passive income" strategies that assume you have $50,000 lying around to invest?

I'm not doing that.

Web mining can be a legitimate way to support creators and generate supplemental income. But—and this is a big but—there are plenty of situations where mining is a bad idea. Not "bad" like unethical, but "bad" like running your dishwasher during a power outage. Technically possible, practically unwise, potentially destructive.

So let's talk honestly about when you should absolutely NOT mine, when you should think carefully about it, and how to make smart decisions about resource allocation. Because the last thing anyone needs is another technology promising the moon while hiding the craters.

---

## 🛑 When You Should Absolutely NOT Mine

These aren't suggestions. These are hard stops. If you're in one of these situations, close the mining tab and do something else.

### **1. During Intensive Work or Creative Tasks**

**If you're doing any of these, stop mining immediately:**

- 🎬 **Video editing or rendering**: Your timeline scrubbing needs every CPU cycle, and mining will turn a 10-second render into a 2-minute slideshow
- 💻 **Code compilation**: That 30-second build becomes 5 minutes when mining is stealing cycles from your compiler
- 🎮 **Gaming**: Your frame rate matters, and mining WILL cause stuttering, lag, and rage-quits you'll blame on lag when it's actually your mining window in the background
- 🎨 **3D rendering or CAD work**: Blender doesn't care about your side hustle, and neither does your CPU when it's trying to calculate physics simulations
- 🎵 **Audio production**: Real-time audio processing has zero tolerance for interruptions, and mining-induced CPU spikes cause pops, clicks, and destroyed takes
- 📊 **Large dataset analysis**: If you're running data science models, statistical analysis, or machine learning training, mining is actively sabotaging your work
- 🎥 **Live streaming**: Dropped frames are not cute, and your viewers will notice

**Why this matters:**

These tasks are *latency-sensitive* and *resource-hungry*. They need consistent, predictable CPU access. Mining creates variable CPU load patterns that interfere with time-critical processes. It's not about the total CPU percentage—it's about the unpredictability.

**Real example:** I once tried mining at 15% throttle while compiling a large C++ project. Normally a 45-second build. With mining? Three and a half minutes. Why? Because the compiler's parallel build system kept getting interrupted by mining threads, creating cascading delays as dependent files waited for their dependencies. Turned off mining, build time went back to 45 seconds.

Your productive work is worth infinitely more than the $0.03 per hour mining generates.

### **2. On Mobile Devices (With Rare Exceptions)**

**Mobile mining is usually a bad idea because:**

- 🔋 **Battery anxiety is real**: Mining accelerates battery drain by 30-50%, turning your "comfortable afternoon" into "desperately hunting for outlets"
- 🔥 **Thermal throttling kicks in fast**: Phones are designed to shed heat passively; sustained CPU load makes them hot enough to be uncomfortable to hold
- 📱 **Prolonged heat damages batteries**: Lithium-ion batteries degrade faster at elevated temperatures, literally shortening your device's lifespan
- 📶 **Mobile data costs add up**: Mining uses minimal bandwidth, but if you're on a metered cellular plan, every kilobyte counts
- ⚡ **Performance impact is more noticeable**: Mobile CPUs are designed for burst performance, not sustained load; mining makes everything feel sluggish

**The ONLY time mobile mining might be acceptable:**

- ✅ Device is plugged in and charging
- ✅ You're on WiFi (never on cellular data)
- ✅ Throttle is set to 10% maximum
- ✅ You're actively using the device (not leaving it mining unattended)
- ✅ Your device has good cooling (newer flagship phones, not budget models)
- ✅ You understand you're trading battery longevity for support

**Even then,** you're probably better off just making a small donation. The computational value you're generating doesn't justify the hardware wear.

**Why mobile is different:**

Desktop computers have large heatsinks, active cooling fans, and power supplies designed for sustained load. Mobile devices have thermal paste the size of a grain of rice and pray for good airflow. They're fundamentally different machines with different thermal envelopes.

---

### **3. On Borrowed, Shared, or Work Computers**

**Never, ever mine on computers that aren't entirely yours:**

- 🏢 **Work computers**: This is potentially a fireable offense. Corporate IT monitors resource usage, and you're using company electricity and hardware for personal gain
- 🏫 **School computers**: Same principle—it's not your hardware, not your electricity, not your decision
- 📚 **Library or public computers**: Shared resources belong to everyone; monopolizing CPU cycles is basically cutting in line
- 👨‍👩‍👧 **Family computers**: If other people use the machine, they need to consent to the resource allocation
- 💼 **Client machines**: If you're doing IT work or freelance tech support, mining on a client's computer is catastrophically unprofessional

**Why this is non-negotiable:**

It's not your resource to allocate. Full stop. Even if you think "they'll never notice," consent requires informed permission from the owner. Mining without explicit permission on someone else's hardware is theft—you're stealing their electricity and computational capacity.

**The consequences are real:**

- Companies have fired employees for unauthorized crypto mining
- Students have been suspended for mining on school networks
- Freelancers have lost all their clients after mining on customer equipment
- Families have broken up over electricity bills and trust violations

If you have to ask "will they notice?", you already know the answer is "don't do it."

---

### **4. When You're on Battery Power (Any Device)**

**The math doesn't work:**

Let's say you mine for 2 hours on battery power at 25% throttle:
- Electricity value: ~$0.05 worth of computational work
- Battery degradation cost: ~$0.50-1.00 in reduced battery lifespan
- Inconvenience cost: Probably need to find a charger 30-45 minutes sooner

**You're literally paying money to generate less money.**

Lithium-ion batteries have a finite number of charge cycles. Every time you discharge faster (which mining does), you're consuming one of those cycles faster. Over time, this reduces your battery's maximum capacity.

**Exception that proves the rule:**

If you're sitting in an airport with your laptop plugged into a public outlet and you want to support a site you're reading, fine. But know that you're doing it for ideological reasons (supporting the creator), not economic ones (the value generated barely covers the battery wear).

---

### **5. During Heat Waves or in Poor Cooling Situations**

**Thermal reality check:**

- 🌡️ If your room temperature is above 80°F (27°C), mining adds unnecessary heat stress
- 🔥 If your computer is already running hot (fan constantly spinning), don't make it worse
- 🪟 If you're in a poorly ventilated space, mining generates more heat than can be dissipated
- 🧊 If your cooling system is failing (laptop vents clogged with dust), mining accelerates hardware death

**Why heat matters:**

Every 10°C (18°F) increase in operating temperature roughly doubles the failure rate of electronic components. Mining at high ambient temperatures is literally gambling with your hardware's lifespan.

**What "running hot" looks like:**
- Fans running constantly at maximum speed
- Case is warm to the touch (hot on laptops)
- System feels sluggish (thermal throttling engaged)
- Unexpected shutdowns or restarts (thermal protection kicking in)

If your computer is exhibiting any of these symptoms, mining is off the table until you address the cooling issue.

---

### **6. When You're Already at Resource Limits**

**If you're experiencing these, stop mining:**

- 💾 **RAM usage above 90%**: Adding mining to memory pressure causes system-wide slowdowns
- 💿 **Disk usage constantly at 100%**: Mining adds I/O operations that compound existing bottlenecks
- 🌐 **Network bandwidth maxed out**: Mining uses minimal bandwidth, but on saturated connections, every bit matters
- ⚠️ **System stability issues**: If your computer is already crashy or unstable, mining will make it worse

**Resource contention is multiplicative, not additive:**

If your system is already struggling, adding mining doesn't just reduce available resources by 10-25%. It creates *contention*—multiple processes fighting for limited resources, causing slowdowns disproportionate to the CPU percentage mining uses.

**Real-world example:**

Friend tried mining on a laptop with 4GB of RAM while running Chrome with 30 tabs, Slack, and Spotify. Mining used "only" 20% CPU according to Task Manager, but the system ground to a halt. Why? RAM pressure forced constant disk swapping, and mining's periodic memory access triggered cache invalidation cascades. Stopped mining, system became responsive again instantly.

## ⚖️ When to Think VERY Carefully

These aren't automatic disqualifiers, but they're yellow flags. Proceed with caution and informed decision-making.

### **1. On Older Hardware (5+ Years Old)**

**The considerations:**

- 🖥️ **Older CPUs are less efficient**: Getting the same computational output requires more power and generates more heat
- 🔌 **Power supplies may be closer to end-of-life**: Adding sustained load to an aging PSU increases failure risk
- 🌡️ **Thermal paste has probably degraded**: Older machines run hotter even at idle; mining exacerbates this
- 💰 **Replacement value is lower**: If mining kills a $200 used laptop, that's a worse trade-off than risking a $2,000 new workstation

**Questions to ask yourself:**

- Is this computer already showing signs of age (loud fans, spontaneous restarts, slow performance)?
- Would I be okay if this machine died tomorrow, or would it be a catastrophe?
- Am I prepared to invest in cleaning, maintenance, or upgrades to make mining safer?
- Is the computational value I'm generating worth the accelerated hardware depreciation?

**The honest answer for most people:** If your computer is old enough to be at risk, the value generated from mining doesn't justify the replacement risk. Better to keep the machine running for actual work than squeeze out $5/month in mining that might cost you a $300 replacement.

### **2. When Electricity Costs Are High**

**Do the math before you start:**

**Average residential electricity costs (2025):**
- US average: $0.15/kWh
- California, Hawaii: $0.30-0.40/kWh  
- Midwest: $0.10-0.12/kWh
- Europe: $0.20-0.35/kWh (varies wildly by country)

**Mining power consumption (very rough estimates):**
- Desktop at 25% throttle: ~25-50 watts additional draw
- Laptop at 25% throttle: ~10-20 watts additional draw

**Example calculation (desktop, $0.30/kWh):**
- Mining 8 hours/day at 35W average = 0.28 kWh/day
- Monthly cost: 0.28 × 30 × $0.30 = **$2.52**
- Mining revenue (Monero, approximate): **$3-6/month**
- Net benefit: **$0.50-3.50/month**

**When mining doesn't make economic sense:**

If your electricity costs are high AND your hardware is inefficient (older CPU, high power draw), you might be mining at a loss. The calculation depends on:
- Your specific hardware (some CPUs mine much more efficiently than others)
- Current Monero prices (volatile)
- Your local electricity rates
- How often you're actually mining

**When it MIGHT still make sense despite high costs:**

- You have solar panels or other renewable energy (effective $0/kWh marginal cost)
- You're ideologically motivated to support creators (economics secondary)
- Your mining time is genuinely "spare cycles" during activities that already require the computer to be on

**Bottom line:** If you're mining to make money and your electricity costs more than $0.20/kWh, do detailed math before committing.

### **3. In Regions with Unreliable Power Grids**

**The concerns:**

- ⚡ **Power surges damage hardware**: Inconsistent power delivery can kill components, especially power supplies
- 🔌 **Voltage fluctuations stress systems**: Mining's sustained load during unstable power accelerates wear
- 💡 **Frequent outages interrupt mining**: Starting and stopping frequently is harder on hardware than steady-state operation
- 💸 **Backup power (UPS) costs negate earnings**: If you need a UPS to mine safely, that's a significant upfront investment

**If you live somewhere with unreliable power:**

- Consider mining only when grid conditions are stable
- Invest in a quality UPS if you're serious about mining
- Use lower throttle settings to reduce stress on power supply
- Monitor voltage if possible and stop mining during unstable conditions

**Reality check:** If power outages happen multiple times per week, the hardware risk probably outweighs mining value.

---

### **4. If You Don't Understand What Mining Actually Does**

**You should NOT mine if:**

- You can't explain in basic terms what cryptocurrency mining is
- You don't know where to check if mining is running or how to stop it
- You haven't looked at your CPU usage in Task Manager/Activity Monitor to see mining's impact
- You're unclear about whether you've given consent or if something was installed without permission
- You don't know which website or software is initiating the mining

**Why technical understanding matters:**

Mining without understanding what's happening is how people get exploited. You need to know enough to recognize:
- The difference between consensual mining and malicious cryptojacking
- When mining should be running vs. when something seems wrong
- How to monitor resource usage and verify everything is as expected
- How to stop mining and uninstall software if needed

**Minimum understanding required:**
- "Mining uses my CPU to solve math problems for a cryptocurrency network"
- "I can see mining in my computer's resource monitor as CPU usage"
- "I gave permission for this specific site/software to mine"
- "I can stop it by [closing the browser tab / clicking stop / uninstalling software]"

If you can't confidently state those four things, don't mine yet. Learn first, mine second.

## ✅ When Mining Actually Makes Sense

After all those warnings, here's the good news: there ARE situations where mining is genuinely a reasonable choice.

### **The Sweet Spot Scenarios**

**Browsing and Reading:**
- You're reading long-form content (articles, documentation, tutorials)
- Your browser is open but you're not doing intensive tasks
- Computer would be on anyway for what you're doing
- Throttle set to 10-25% leaves plenty of resources for smooth browsing

**Background Activities:**
- Watching video streams (YouTube, Twitch) that don't require much CPU
- Listening to music or podcasts
- Having reference materials open while working on something else (on paper, for example)
- Any activity where the computer is "waiting for you" rather than processing

**Idle Time (with supervision):**
- Taking a lunch break but leaving computer on
- Stepping away for 15-30 minutes but planning to return
- Device is on and you're in the room but not actively using it

**Supporting Creators You Value:**
- Reading a blog or news site you genuinely appreciate
- Using documentation for open-source projects you rely on
- Engaging with educational content that's helping you learn
- Any scenario where you'd consider donating but prefer contributing computationally

### **The Resource Availability Checklist**

Before you start mining, verify:

- [ ] **CPU usage is below 50%** (leaving room for mining + unexpected tasks)
- [ ] **RAM usage is below 80%** (memory pressure causes system-wide slowdowns)
- [ ] **Device is plugged into power** (or you've consciously accepted battery trade-off)
- [ ] **Cooling is adequate** (fans not maxed out, case not hot to touch)
- [ ] **No intensive work planned** (next 30+ minutes is genuinely low-priority activity)
- [ ] **You can monitor resource usage** (Task Manager/Activity Monitor open or easily accessible)
- [ ] **One-click stop is available** (you know exactly how to stop mining instantly)

If all those boxes are checked, mining is probably fine.

## 🎯 Your Personal Decision Framework

Everyone's situation is different. Here's a worksheet approach to making smart decisions about mining.

### **Scenario-Based Decision Tree**

**Start here:** What are you doing right now?

**Intensive work (gaming, video editing, coding, 3D rendering)**  
→ **DON'T MINE**  
Your work is worth infinitely more than mining revenue.

**Browsing, reading, or watching content**  
→ Continue to next question

**Is your device plugged into power?**  
→ No → **THINK CAREFULLY** (battery wear probably not worth it)  
→ Yes → Continue to next question

**Is your CPU usage currently below 50%?**  
→ No → **DON'T MINE** (system already at capacity)  
→ Yes → Continue to next question

**Is this your personal computer that you own?**  
→ No → **DON'T MINE** (need owner's explicit permission)  
→ Yes → Continue to next question

**Do you understand what mining does and how to stop it?**  
→ No → **LEARN FIRST** (understanding required for informed consent)  
→ Yes → Continue to next question

**Are you mining to support a creator/site you value?**  
→ Yes → **MINE AT 10-25% THROTTLE** (you're making an informed choice)  
→ No, just for money → **THINK CAREFULLY** (earnings are minimal; make sure economics work)

## 🛠️ Practical Resource Management Tips

If you decide mining makes sense for your situation, here's how to do it responsibly.

### **1. Start Conservative, Adjust Up**

**Default starting point:**
- Begin with 10% throttle
- Mine for 30 minutes
- Check CPU temperature, fan noise, and system responsiveness
- If everything feels fine, consider increasing to 15% or 20%
- Never exceed 50% throttle unless you're absolutely certain your cooling can handle it

**Why gradual matters:**

Every system is different. Two computers with identical specs can have vastly different thermal characteristics based on case airflow, ambient temperature, dust accumulation, and thermal paste condition. Start small and learn your system's limits empirically.

---

### **2. Monitor Actively (At First)**

**What to watch:**

**Windows:** Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc), go to Performance tab
- **CPU usage:** Should show mining's throttle percentage + browser/system overhead
- **Temperature:** If available (requires third-party software like HWMonitor), watch CPU temps
- **Fan speed:** Listen for changes in fan noise

**Mac:** Open Activity Monitor (Cmd+Space, type "Activity Monitor")
- **CPU tab:** Look for mining-related processes
- **Energy tab:** Shows power impact
- **Listen for fan changes:** MacBooks are aggressive about thermal management

**What's normal:**
- CPU usage increases by roughly throttle percentage (25% throttle ≈ 25% CPU increase)
- Fans may spin up slightly but shouldn't sound like a jet engine
- System remains responsive for browsing, typing, and basic tasks
- Temperature increases by 5-15°C (10-25°F) above idle

**Red flags:**
- System becomes sluggish or unresponsive
- Fans go to maximum speed and stay there
- Unexpected shutdowns or restarts (thermal protection)
- Error messages or browser crashes

If you see red flags, stop mining immediately and reassess.

---

### **3. Set Up Your Environment for Success**

**Improve your mining conditions:**

- 🌡️ **Ensure good airflow:** Don't mine with laptop on soft surfaces (beds, couches) that block vents
- 🧹 **Clean your computer:** Dust buildup in fans and heatsinks severely degrades cooling
- ❄️ **Control ambient temperature:** If your room is 85°F, mining is riskier than at 70°F
- 🔋 **Use power settings wisely:** Set computer to high-performance mode if mining regularly (balanced/power-saver modes conflict with mining goals)
- 📊 **Install monitoring software:** Tools like HWMonitor or Core Temp let you see actual temperatures

**Laptop-specific tips:**

- Use a laptop cooling pad if mining regularly
- Consider a laptop stand to improve bottom airflow
- Don't cover the keyboard (heat escapes through it on many models)
- Mine only when plugged in (bear repeating: battery mining is almost always wrong)

---

### **4. Create Mining Rules for Yourself**

**Example personal mining policy:**

```
MY MINING RULES:

✅ I WILL mine when:
• Reading articles/documentation for 20+ minutes
• Watching streams/videos and not doing other tasks
• On AC power, CPU under 40%, device cool
• Throttle 15% on laptop, 25% on desktop

❌ I WILL NOT mine when:
• Gaming, video editing, or coding
• In a video call or voice chat
• On battery power (no exceptions)
• Room temp above 78°F
• Using borrowed/work computer

⚠️ I WILL STOP IMMEDIATELY if:
• System becomes sluggish
• Fans go to maximum speed
• Any intensive work suddenly needed
• Battery drops below 30% (if I broke my own rule)
```

**Why explicit rules help:**

Decision fatigue is real. If you have to evaluate "should I mine right now?" every single time, you'll make poor choices. Having preset rules means you can mine confidently when conditions are right and stop guilt-free when they're not.

## 💭 The Bigger Picture: Mining Is Supplemental, Not Primary

Here's the most important thing I can tell you about mining: **it's not a solution to financial problems.**

### **Setting Realistic Expectations**

**What mining IS:**
- A way to support creators with spare computational resources
- Supplemental income comparable to putting a few dollars in a tip jar monthly
- An alternative to ads and subscriptions for funding content
- An interesting experiment in digital economics
- A legitimate choice for those with compatible situations

**What mining IS NOT:**
- A replacement for actual income
- A "passive income" strategy (it requires active management)
- A way to make significant money
- Suitable for everyone in every situation
- Without trade-offs and limitations

**Realistic earnings expectations:**

- **Desktop, 25% throttle, 8 hours/day:** $3-8/month (varies with hardware and Monero prices)
- **Laptop, 15% throttle, 4 hours/day:** $1-3/month
- **Browsing on various sites, inconsistent:** $0.50-2/month

These numbers assume decent hardware (2018 or newer) and current Monero prices. Older hardware earns less. Price crashes reduce earnings proportionally.

**Compare to alternatives:**

- Skip one $5 latte per month: Same impact as mining 40+ hours
- Donate $10 directly to a creator: Equivalent to ~100 hours of mining
- Subscribe to Patreon for $5/month: More valuable to creator than your mining revenue

**So why mine at all?**

Because:
- You're ideologically motivated to support consent-based funding models
- You enjoy the technical aspects of participating in cryptocurrency networks
- You have genuinely spare resources that would otherwise go completely unused
- You prefer computational contribution over monetary contribution
- You want to support multiple sites/creators without per-site subscription costs

These are all legitimate reasons. Just be honest with yourself about which one applies.

---

## 🎚️ The Control You Deserve

Here's what makes ethical mining fundamentally different from ads, subscriptions, or hidden corporate data extraction: **you're in control of the trade-off.**

### **Mining Puts You in the Driver's Seat**

**With ads, you get:**
- ❌ No control over resource usage
- ❌ No visibility into data collection
- ❌ No way to adjust intensity
- ❌ No stop button
- ❌ No relationship between your experience and creator compensation

**With mining, you get:**
- ✅ Throttle control (adjust CPU usage to your needs)
- ✅ One-click stop (instant cessation, no questions asked)
- ✅ Resource monitoring (see exactly what's happening)
- ✅ Scheduling options (mine only during specific times/activities)
- ✅ Direct support (your resources go to the creator you're engaging with)

**This guide exists because control requires information.**

You can't make good decisions about mining without understanding:
- When it makes sense and when it doesn't
- What the trade-offs actually are
- How to monitor and manage resource usage
- What realistic outcomes look like

That's what I've tried to provide: honest information so you can make informed choices.

---

## 🌟 Final Thoughts: Permission to Say No

I'm going to say something that might seem strange coming from someone explaining mining: **it's completely okay to never mine.**

Not everyone's situation is compatible with mining. Not everyone's values align with cryptocurrency participation. Not everyone wants to add one more thing to think about in their digital life. All of those positions are entirely valid.

The goal of ethical mining isn't to get everyone mining all the time. It's to offer an alternative funding model for those who:
- Have the resources to spare
- Understand what they're participating in  
- Choose to contribute computationally instead of financially
- Value the transparency and control this model provides

If that's not you, that's genuinely fine.

**What matters is understanding the options:**

- 💰 **Direct financial support** (donations, Patreon, subscriptions): Most efficient value transfer to creators
- ⛏️ **Computational contribution** (mining): Alternative for those with spare resources and compatible situations  
- 📊 **Ad-supported content** (with blockers or without): Accepting surveillance and manipulation as payment
- 🚫 **Nothing** (using content without compensation): Honest about the free-rider problem but acknowledging not everyone can afford to support everything

Each model has different trade-offs. Mining isn't morally superior to the others—it's just another option with its own benefits and limitations.

**The real question isn't "should everyone mine?"**

The real question is: "For those who want to support creators and have the resources to do so, should mining be an available option?"

I think the answer is yes, as long as:
- Consent is explicit and revocable
- Resource usage is transparent and controllable
- Limitations are honestly communicated
- Alternative support methods remain available

This guide has been about helping you figure out whether mining fits YOUR situation. If it doesn't, you now know why and can make informed decisions about alternatives. If it does, you now have the information to do it responsibly.

Either way, you're making a choice based on understanding rather than hype—and that's what ethical technology should enable.
